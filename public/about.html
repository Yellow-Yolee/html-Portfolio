<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, and thanks for stopping by!</p>

<p>I’m someone who’s always been drawn to big questions 
  and bold ideas—especially when it comes to science, 
  technology, and the future. Stories like 
  2001: A Space Odyssey sparked my imagination and 
  continue to shape the way I see the 
  world: as a place full of wonder, potential, and 
  unexpected discoveries.
</p>
<p>Right now, I’m working on my TEFL certification, 
  with the goal of teaching English and building 
  meaningful connections across cultures. I also spend 
  time volunteering in my community, and I’m slowly 
  teaching myself Chichewa—one of the many ways I enjoy 
  exploring different perspectives.

<p>This site is a space where I’ll share what I’m learning, 
  thinking about, or working on. Whether you're here 
  out of curiosity or common interest, welcome!</p>
